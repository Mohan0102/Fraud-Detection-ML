This system should automatically analyze each transaction and assign a fraud probability score. Transactions with high fraud probability can be temporarily blocked or flagged for manual verification. This will help stop fraud before it happens.***\n\n***The company should also implement transaction limits for new users and unusual transactions. For example, if a customer suddenly transfers a large amount that is much higher than their normal transaction pattern, the system should request additional authentication such as OTP verification.***\n\n***Another important prevention method is continuous monitoring of customer behavior. Fraudulent transactions often show unusual patterns such as transferring money to new accounts, rapid multiple transactions, or large transaction amounts. The company should track these behavioral changes and generate alerts.***\n\n***The company should also regularly update and retrain the fraud detection model using new transaction data.

A reduction in successful fraud transactions indicates the system is effective.***\n\n***Second, evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score should be used. Recall is especially important because it measures how many fraud cases are correctly detected.

A very high false positive rate can affect customer experience, so it should be balanced.***\n\n***Fourth, the total financial loss due to fraud should be tracked.
